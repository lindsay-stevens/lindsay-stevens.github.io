# Skills
I have 8.5 years' experience in academic health research. I have developed strong skills in two main areas:

- Software application development
- Clinical trial data and project management


## Software Application Development
An overview of my skills and experience in this area is below, followed by descriptions of some example projects (most of which are on GitHub):

- Programming languages:
    - Advanced: SQL, PL/PGSQL (PostgreSQL procedural language), Python, Visual Basic and XSLT
    - Intermediate: JavaScript, PHP, Stata, SAS, Powershell/CMD and Java
- Environments:
    - Advanced: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Android 4.4 to 6
    - Intermediate: Ubuntu Server 14, Docker, Google Suite for Education
- Servers: PostgreSQL 8.4 to 9.6, Apache 2.4, Tomcat 6 to 7
- Development: Git, Intellij IDEA, Notepad++


### Community DataMart
DataMart is a reporting tool implemented PostgreSQL using SQL, PL/PGSQL, and Python. Study definition metadata is read from an OpenClinica database and used to prepare tabulated data in a user-friendly format.

The deployment includes encrypted connections between servers and clients, strong access controls, and Windows domain integrated authentication. Client tools included for integration via ODBC with Stata, SAS and Microsoft Access.

This is used by many OpenClinica users as a key part of their data management processes, as well as integration with other data sources or reporting tools.


### ODK Tools and Deployment
The ODK Tools application is a build tool implemented in Python. It provides a simple user interface for form designers to run scripts that convert Excel-based form definitions to XML, validate the XML, produce images for each form question in each specified language, and prepare a deployment package for each participating site.

This is used as part of a deployment of 83 (and growing) Android tablets for offline data collection at research study sites, including hospitals, clinics and prisons in Australia and internationally. I was reponsible for planning device configuration and management processes, and preparing training materials for end users.


### Python Web Projects
A collection of smaller projects related to the web:

- Webservice clients OpenClinica's SOAP XML webservices, and LimeSurvey's REST JSON webservices
- Integration between LabKey's REST JSON webservice and OpenClinica to map and import daily hepatitis C test results
- A study promotional site using Django. Deployed on Windows as a service using CherryPy and pywin32, behind an Apache httpd reverse proxy
- A functional test suite for a custom, Bootstrap-themed LimeSurvey template using Selenium. Validated cross-browser behaviour of JavaScript shims and monkey-patches


## Clinical Trial Data and Project Management
An overview of my skills and experience in this area is below. Project names and registry identifiers are detailed under the relevant role in the [Employment](#employment) section.

- Experience in building data systems with:
    - OpenClinica: a web based tool for managing clinical trial data collection and cleaning
    - ODK Collect: an Android app for data collection
    - TeleForm: an Optical Character Recognition tool for digitising paper form data
    - LimeSurvey: a web based questionnaire collection tool
- Coordination experience:
    - Compliance with ethics and regulatory requirements including the TGA guidance on ICH GCP, the NHMRC National Statement, and Australian Privacy Principles
    - Completion of standard forms including NEAF, SSA, CTN, and CIOMS SAE reports
    - Australia-wide and international clinical trials collaborating with hospitals, clinics, academic institutions, CROs, and pharmaceutical companies
    - Project management, staff training and collaboration with healthcare and research professionals
